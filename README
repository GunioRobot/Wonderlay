# Wonderlay

This is an experimental framework. It's heavily based on top of
[Alloy Framework](http://alloyframework.org/), practically reproducing it's code
at a lot of places.

The changes to the original code are not supposed to be better or worst. They
are just experiments, trying to incorporate things from other cool frameworks
like CakePHP, express.js, Sinatra, Slim and so on.

This is not ready for production and there is no road map for now, but if you
would like to suggest something, please, fork away.
